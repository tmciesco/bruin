This repository is a work in progress as I put together a design system using styled-components. The goal is to create clear, repeatable syntax that can be used to create predictable designs across projects. A large focus is also placed on the ability to create custom themes for each project without needing to re-learn a new design system language.

This repository has a dependency on styled-components, and my standard theme currently uses the Assistant and K2D fonts from Google Fonts.
